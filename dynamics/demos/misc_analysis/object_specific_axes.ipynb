    "### Analyzing SSPs with Object-Specific Axes\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, one would like to encode a variety of objects in a single SSP and apply a single transformation to the SSP to advance the position of each object along its own unique trajectory. Earlier work illustrates that it is straightforward to apply a linear transformation that advances the position of a single object in isolation, or a linear transformation that advances the position of all objects identically. \n",

    "Below, the use of different spatial axis vectors to encode each object is considered as a solution to this difficulty."

    "due to the properties of fractional exponentiation with HRRs. It is not easy, however, to shift each object independently using this approach. So, we might introduce separate axis encoding vectors for each object and have different parts of a transformation act on specific subsets of these vectors. For instance, we could encode objects as follows:\n",

There are $N$ terms in the bracketed sum, so the creation of $N-1$ noise terms occurs $N$ times, leading to a total of $N^2 - N$ noise terms overall. This is obviously not great for scaling up to large numbers of objects, even if the noise is zero-mean. Below is an illustration of the effect of this scaling:"

There are $N$ terms in the bracketed sum, so the creation of $Nâˆ’1$ noise terms occurs $N$ times, leading to a total of $N^2-N$ noise terms after a single time step. On the next time step, there each term in the bracketed sum applies to one corresponding term in $N$, and then combines with the $N-1$ other encoding terms and the $N^2 - N$ noise terms created by on the previous time step; again, these combinations $N$ times. This yields a total of $N * (N-1 + N^2 - N) = N^3 - N$ noise terms on the second time step. After $t$ timesteps, the number of noise terms is $N^{t+1} - N$."
